[pipenv](https:\\pipenv.readthedocs.io)
A virtual environment was used at the start of the project.  This was installed using ```pip install pipenv```
Next thing I used the command ```pipenv install django```  to install django in my virtual environment
then I used ```pipenv shell``` to install the virutal environment in my django project.
Next I started a new django project inside my brightenup folder using the command ```django-admin startproject positivetimes .```
Next to check that everything was working I typed ```python manage.py runserver`` into the terminal and got the congratulations screen from django.
